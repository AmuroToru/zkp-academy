title: 'What do you need to do to add '

---


Let's say we would like to add a new function in sp1's riscv machine 
SQR that takes a u32 x and returns  x * x

There are two ways of doing it. 
Add SQR as an instruction in RISCV or as an pre-compile.

What do you need to do to add a new risc-v instruction on SP1?

What do you need to do to add a new pre-compile in sp1?


Read sp1 code https://github.com/succinctlabs/sp1
with this two questions.
You should mainly read codes in the crates/core.
